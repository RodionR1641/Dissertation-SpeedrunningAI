# Mario Reinforcement Learning Benchmark

![Mario Gameplay Demo](media/demo.gif) 

A comprehensive benchmark of 8 deep reinforcement learning methods applied to Super Mario Bros, comparing their performance in speedrunning and completion tasks.

## üìå Key Features
- **8 RL Algorithms Implemented**, based on 4 base algorithms(PPO,A2C,Dueling DDQN, Rainbow DQN)
- **Speedrunning Focus**: Optimized for fast level completion
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new algorithms
- **WandB Integration**: Full training metrics tracking

## üìã Contents
1. **Implemented Algorithms**
   - [x] Duelling DDQN (Double Deep Q-Network)
   - [x] PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
   - [x] PPO with a ViT(Vision Transformer) model  
   - [x] PPO with an LSTM layer
   - [x] PPO with RND exploration bonus (Random Network Distillation)
   - [x] A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
   - [x] Rainbow DQN
   - [x] Rainbow DQN with RND 

2. **Research Focus**
   - Speedrunning performance metrics of completion time and episodic reward return
   - Comparison between CNN and ViT architectures
   - Evaluation of RND as an exploration bonus

## üõ† Requirements

### Base requirements
- Python 3.8+

## üìä Results

![Alt Text](images/diagram.png "Optional Title")

### Key Findings
1. **PPO** variations achieved fastest completion times, achieving the best time of 355 seconds on first level(completion time of 45 seconds).

2. **Implementation and hyperparameter tuning** decides the performance of an agent, regardless of a method having good theoretical foundations:
   - Our Rainbow DQN implementation was unable to consistently complete the level given the same hyperparameters as the Original Rainbow DQN paper

3. **CNN and ViT architecture matters** as overly complex models fail to capture
